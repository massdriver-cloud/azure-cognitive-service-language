# Requires agreement checkbox

Unfortunately, no way around this, this is something a customer will need to do. And this should be added to the operator guide. There are several services for Cognitive where the customer will need to explicitly use the Azure portal to create a Language cognitive service and hit **Agree** on the checkbox to provision. This will set the flag for their account, and then will let them deploy the Language service using Terraform. Deploying Terraform without accepting this will cause the deployment to fail with an error explaining why.

# Language Studio

They can use [Language Studio](https://language.cognitive.azure.com/) and log into Azure account to manage their service without an application.

# Future work
* Enable custom question answering (requires cognitive search service)
* Enable custom text classification or name entity recognition (requires storage account)

**Name Entity Recognition (NER)** is pre-configured feature, but can be customized using storage account, allows you to extract info from unstuctured textby training an entity extraction model on top of your dataset stored in your storage account.

**Custom text classification** enables you to build custom AI models to classify unstructured text documents into custom classes you define using your own dataset stored in your storage account

**Custom QnA** finds the most appropriate answer for inputs from your users, and is commonly used to build conversational client apps, such as social media apps, chat bots, and speech-enabled desktop apps
QnA requires search service resource.

### Which Language feature to use?
* Detect/redact sensitive info such as PII or PHI - PII detection
* Extract categories of info w/o custom model - preconfigured NER
* Extract categories of info using a model specific to data - custom NER
* Extract main topics and important phrases - key phrase extraction
* Determine the sentiment and opinions expressed in text - sentiment analysis and opinion mining
* Summarize long chunks of text or conversations - summarization
* Disambiguate entities and get links to wikipedia - entry linking
* Classify documents into one or more categories - custom text classification
* Extract medical information from clincial/medical documents - text analytics for health
* Build a conversational app that responds to user inputs - question answering
* Detect language that a text was written in - language detection
* Predict the intention of user inputs and extract information from them - conversational language understanding
* Connect apps from conversational language understanding, LUIS, and question answering - orchestration workflow

Note: If a feature is customizable, you can train an AI model using our tools to fit your data specifically. Otherwise a feature is pre-configured, meaning the AI models it uses cannot be changed. You just send your data, and use the feature's output in your applications.

### Discovery to do list
- [ ] RBAC testing w/ test app
- [ ] `public_network_access_enabled = false` does this break the API when using RBAC?
